        <li>3 button mushrooms or shiitake mushrooms (80g/2.8 ounces), thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 stalk of green onion (20g/0.7 ounces), diagonally chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp roasted seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sauce</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp raw sugar or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp rice wine/mirin</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp msg free oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp minced garlic</li>

        <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On medium-high heat, boil the water (5 cups) in a medium sized pot. Once itâ€™s rolling boiling, parboil the chicken for 1 minute to skim off any fat. Drain the water.</li>

        <li>In a clean pot (I used this braising pot), add the chicken and the sauce. Boil them over medium-high heat for about 10 mins, covered.</li>

        <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, onions and chillies and boil for a further 7 mins, covered. Reduce the heat to medium and stir gently to change the position of the chicken and the vegetables. Simmer for a further 8 mins, covered</li>
        <li>Add the glass noodles, mushrooms, and green onions and simmer until the noodles and mushrooms are cooked (about 3 to 5 mins), covered. Stir lightly to make sure the noodles and the mushrooms are mixed with the sauce</li>
        <li>Garnish with the sesame seeds. (You can add additional green onions for extra poppy colour before serving as well.) Serve hot with a bowl of steamed rice
        </li>
